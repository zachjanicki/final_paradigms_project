To start running the game, you must have two consoles or two computers with their consoles 
open with all of the files. Note that this game is smoother and easier to play on two 
different computers. Also, X11 forwarding must be enabled on the consoles and computer.

When this is set up,  player 1 types: $ python3 player1.py into his or her console and press
enter. Then player 2 will type: $ python player2.py into his or her console and press enter.
Note that player1 must enter his/her command first before player2.
This should open a new window on each of the players' respective screens. If playing on one
computer, both windows will show up and begin to load.

Once loaded, the game will begin and the window should display two paddles, two balls, and two
sets of bricks (one for each player). On player 1's game, he or she will be controlling the paddle
on the bottom using the left and right arrow keys. On player 2's game, he or she will be
controlling the paddle on the top with the left and right arrow keys. On each player's game,
they should be able to see the other player's paddle and ball movements. 

The goal of the game is to get rid of all of the bricks on their respective side before the 
other player does. If a player misses the ball, that player will lose.
